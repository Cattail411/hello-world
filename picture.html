	<p>I love a good story. I have heard and seen many stories in my lifetime. Here are some pictures that depict the kinds of stories that I love.</p>
	<p>I grew up with a dad who loves science-fiction stories, such as <font style="italic">Star Trek</font style> and <font style="italic">Star Wars.</font style> Because of that, I love to read science-fiction and fantasy stories. But, there are still other kinds of stories out there.</p>

	<p>My mom always encouraged me to read classic stories. My favorite kind of classic story is the romantic kind, <font style="italic">Pride and Prejudice</font style> being one of the best. Since reading that, I have read many other classic tales. I have also read and seen a bit of Shakespeare's poetry and plays, thanks to my parents' love of theatre. But romance and sci-fi aren't the only genres that intrigue me.</p>

	<p>I love a good mystery. Naturally, I have read <font style="italic">The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</font style> by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as well as some new <font style="italic">Sherlock</font style> stories by modern authors. I've read so many of his adventures that sometimes I find myself coming up with my own solution to the problem before Sherlock does.</p>
