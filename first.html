<h2> This is a Heading</h2>

	Hello. This is not a very exciting document. I bet you were expecting <em>poetry</em>, or some kind of <strong>exciting <br> fact</strong> about the Internet and the World Wide Web.
	<p> Sorry, no such luck. This document does contain examples of HTML markup. For example, here is an "unordered list": <ul>
	<li> One item in the list
	<li> A second list item <li> A third list item that goes on and on and on to indicate that the lists can wrap right around the page and still be nicely formatted by the browsers.
	<li> The final item on the list 
	</ul> </p>
	<p> Lists are exciting. You can also have ordered lists (the items are numbered) and description lists.
	<hr>
	 And you can draw horizontal lines, which are useful for dividing sections.</p>
