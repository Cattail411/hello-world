I have read and heard so many stories it is difficult to keep track of them all. But, I can tell you a bit of my family's story.\r\n\r\nMy dad, Kwin, is the eldest of two sisters and one brother and a genius in his own way. He works for an elecricity company downtown. He is brilliant when it comes to technology, new ideas, teaching, music and theater. He worked as a radio DJ when he was much younger. From him, I learned about technology and the love of music.\r\n\r\nMy mom, Shanna, is the oldest member of my family and the oldest of seven kids: two sisters and four brothers(the last two twins). She is great at editing photos and putting videos together. She works as a secretary for a law firm near our home. She met my dad at SUU and they bonded through their love of theatre. She works very hard for all of us and I love her and my dad so much!\r\n\r\nArmstrong is my little brother, though lately he has grown taller than me. He is the only native Utahn in our family and is younger than me by six years. He's tall, cute, skinny and clever(though he never likes to admit it). He loves coding and is great at playing games. He also plays the trumpet.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm not coding at school or working at Wendy's, I'm either reading, playing videogames, watching TV or movies with my family, singing, or playing my violin. Over the years, I have learned to play certain pieces of music from my favorite shows just by listening to them. No sheet music required! \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to stories, I have a wide variety of favorite genres. I love classic reads like \"Pride and Prejudice\" as well as the works of Shakespeare. I also love a good mystery, and no one can provide a good mystery better than Sherlock Holmes. Science-fiction and fantasy is my absolute favorite. I've read every \"Harry Potter\" book and love \"Star Wars\" and \"Star Trek.\" Lately, I have become a fan of the BBC show \"Doctor Who.\" To show how much of a \"Whovian\" I am, I have provided a link to a webpage that I have created that lists all of the Doctor's companions from the beginning and who they are in the show.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have also created other pages. To view the pages, highlight a link, right-click and go to \"Open URL\" and it will take you to the webpage.\r\n  \r\nfile:///Users/lilypeterson/Documents/list.html  \r\nfile:///Users/lilypeterson/Documents/iframes.html  \r\nfile:///Users/lilypeterson/Documents/picture.html  \r\nfile:///Users/lilypeterson/Documents/resume.html  \r\nfile:///Users/lilypeterson/Documents/password.html",
