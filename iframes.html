	<h1>Mormon historian sheds more light on the 1838 attack on poet Eliza Snow</h1>
		<p>Most people think of Mormons as people that haven't gone through many hard times, that they haven't got a care in the world, or that they haven't gone through any of the problems that the world is facing today. If they knew the true history of the LDS church and about the history of its members, they would be proven wrong. One of the most famous women of the LDS church did end up suffering at the hands of eight monsters and it cost her dearly. Initially, this story was just a rumor, but new evidence has arisen that validates the account of an attack on Eliza R. Snow, celebrated poet and lyricist for the LDS church.</p>

		<p>Accounts say that the attack took place in the year 1838, when the Saints were living in Independence, MI. Eliza Snow was raped by eight mobsters. The attack was so brutal that she was unable to ever have children. When the prophet Joseph Smith heard about what happened, he promised her that "she would be a Mother in Israel. One to whom all eyes should turn, to whom all ears would listen to hear her sing (in tounges) in praises of Zion."</p>
		<p>In the early days of the LDS church, the Saints were still trying to figure out how marriages worked for their religion. Everyone knows about the polygamy part, but did you know that at first, everyone was "sealed," as they call it, to the prophet Joseph Smith? Eliza was sealed to him four years after the attack. When Smith was martyred, she married the next prophet, Brigham Young. The story of the attack was actually taken from a descendent of a friend of Eliza Snow. Her story is one of strength and endurance in the face of tragedy.</p>
